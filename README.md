# NotesApp
A notes app for all of them.


Man, I'm tired of trying to learn notion or use google docs. I want to be able to seamlessly draw with my digital pen, type next to it, and insert diagrams. 

Notion is cool and all, but... not really.

This app may not be user friendly to YOU, but it's probably just how I like it. Probably.
